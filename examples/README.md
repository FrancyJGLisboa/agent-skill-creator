## 📁 **Simple Skill Example**

### **PDF Text Extractor**
**Location:** `pdf-text-extractor-cskill/`

**Architecture:**
```
pdf-text-extractor-cskill/
├── SKILL.md              ← Single comprehensive skill file
├── scripts/              ← Optional supporting code
├── references/           ← Optional documentation
└── assets/               ← Optional templates
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Single objective: Extract text from PDFs
- ✅ Focused functionality: Text extraction + cleaning
- ✅ Simple workflow: Input → Process → Output
- ✅ Minimal dependencies: PyPDF2, python-docx
- ✅ Easy to maintain: One developer can handle
- ✅ Clear scope: PDF processing only

**When to Use This Pattern:**
- Task automation with clear boundaries
- Single workflow requirement
- Proof of concept or MVP
- Personal productivity tools
- Learning projects

## 🏗️ **Complex Skill Suite Example**

### **Financial Analysis Suite**
**Location:** `financial-analysis-suite-cskill/`

**Architecture:**
```
financial-analysis-suite-cskill/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json  ← Organizes component skills
├── data-acquisition-cskill/     ← Component Skill 1
│   └── SKILL.md
├── technical-analysis-cskill/   ← Component Skill 2
│   └── SKILL.md
├── portfolio-optimization-cskill/ ← Component Skill 3
│   └── SKILL.md
├── reporting-cskill/           ← Component Skill 4
│   └── SKILL.md
└── shared/              ← Common resources
    ├── utils/
    └── config/
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Multiple objectives: Data acquisition + analysis + optimization + reporting

- **Quick Development**: Days, not weeks

**Examples:**
- Document converter
- Data cleaner
- Report generator
- API client

### **Choose Complex Skill Suite When:**

- **Multiple Objectives**: "I need a complete financial analysis platform"
- **Complex Workflows**: Multiple interconnected processes
- **Domain Specialization**: Different expertise areas needed
- **Team Development**: Multiple contributors
- **Long-term Investment**: Weeks to months development

**Examples:**
- Business intelligence platform
- Complete workflow automation
- Industry-specific solutions
- Enterprise applications

## 🔄 **Migration Paths**

### **Simple → Complex**
When a simple skill grows:

1. **Identify Natural Breakpoints**
   - Separate concerns within the skill
   - Find logical groupings of functionality

2. **Extract Component Skills**
   - Create separate SKILL.md files
   - Move relevant code to component directories

3. **Create Integration Layer**
   - Add marketplace.json
   - Define communication protocols
   - Create shared utilities

4. **Refactor and Test**
   - Ensure components work independently
   - Validate integration functionality
   - Update documentation

**Example:** PDF Extractor → Document Processing Suite
- PDF extraction (current)
- OCR processing (new component)
- Document classification (new component)
- Metadata extraction (new component)

### **Complex → Simple**
When simplifying a complex suite:

1. **Identify Core Functionality**
   - Find the most valuable component
   - Determine essential features

2. **Consolidate Components**
   - Merge related skills
   - Eliminate redundant functionality
   - Simplify workflows

3. **Maintain Essential Features**
   - Keep critical capabilities
   - Preserve important integrations
   - Update user interfaces
