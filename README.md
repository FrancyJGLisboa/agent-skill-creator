## 💬 **FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions**

### **🎯 General Questions**

#### **Q: What exactly is Agent Creator?**
**A:** Agent Creator is a meta-skill that teaches Claude Code how to create complete, production-ready agents autonomously. You describe what you want to automate, and Agent Creator handles all the technical implementation.

**A:** ChatGPT gives you code snippets you implement yourself. Agent Creator creates complete, installable agents that you can use immediately without any programming required.

#### **Q: Can I create agents for any domain?**
**A:** Yes! Agent Creator can create agents for any domain that has available data sources - finance, agriculture, healthcare, e-commerce, research, and more.

### **🔧 Technical Questions**

#### **Q: What programming languages do the created agents use?**
**A:** Agents are created in Python with modern best practices, type hints, and comprehensive error handling.

#### **Q: Can agents connect to databases and APIs?**
**A:** Yes! Agents can integrate with databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), REST APIs, Google Sheets, and most data sources.

#### **Q: Are the created agents secure?**

### **🧠 v2.1 Learning Questions**
