## 🔄 How It Works Internally (5 Phases)

### PHASE 1: Discovery (API Research)

**What it does:**
- Research available public APIs for the domain
- Uses `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` to find options
- Compares APIs by: coverage, cost, rate limits, quality
- **DECIDES** autonomously which to use

**Example (Agriculture):**
```bash
WebSearch: "US agriculture API free historical data"
WebSearch: "USDA API documentation"
WebFetch: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api

→ DECISION: USDA NASS QuickStats API
  Justification: Free, data since 1866, all crops
```

---

### PHASE 2: Design (Analysis Definition)

**What it does:**
- Brainstorm 10-15 typical user questions
- Group by analysis type
- **DEFINES** 4-6 priority analyses
- Specifies methodologies (formulas, interpretations)

**Example:**
```
Typical questions:
- "Corn production in 2023?"
- "Compare soybeans 2024 vs 2023"
- "Top 10 producing states"

→ ANALYSES DEFINED:
  1. YoY Comparison (year vs year)
  2. State Ranking (top producers)
  3. Trend Analysis (trends)
  4. Report Generation (reports)
```

---

### PHASE 3: Architecture (Structuring)

**What it does:**
- Defines folder and file structure
- Specifies responsibilities of each script
- Plans cache strategy and performance

**Example:**
```
→ STRUCTURE:
  scripts/
    - fetch_nass.py (API requests)
    - parse_nass.py (parsing)
    - analyze_nass.py (analyses)
    utils/
      - cache_manager.py
      - rate_limiter.py
```

---

### PHASE 4: Detection (Automatic Activation)

**What it does:**
- Lists domain keywords
- Determines when skill should activate
- Creates optimized description

**Example:**
```
→ KEYWORDS:
  Entities: USDA, NASS, agriculture
  Commodities: corn, soybeans, wheat
  Metrics: production, area, yield
  Actions: compare, ranking, trend
```

---

### PHASE 5: Implementation (Complete Code)

**What it does:**
- Creates **marketplace.json** (REQUIRED!)
- Implements functional Python code
- Writes SKILL.md (5000+ words)
- Creates references with useful content
- Generates real configs

**Commands executed internally:**
```bash
mkdir -p agent-name/{scripts/utils,references,assets,.claude-plugin}
# Write: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
# Write: SKILL.md
# Write: scripts/fetch_*.py
# Write: scripts/parse_*.py
# Write: scripts/analyze_*.py
# Write: utils/cache_manager.py
# Write: references/*.md
# Write: assets/*.json
# Write: README.md
```

## 🔄 How It Works: The 5 Autonomous Phases

### PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (API Research)

**Objective:** DECIDE which API to use

**Process:**
1. Identifies domain (agriculture? finance? climate?)
2. Research available public APIs
3. Compares options (coverage, cost, quality)
4. **DECIDES** with justification
5. Documents decision

**Autonomy:** Claude decides without asking the user!

**Example of internal commands:**
```bash
# Claude executes internally:
WebSearch: "US agriculture API free historical data"
WebFetch: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api
# Compares: NASS vs ERS vs FAO
# → DECISION: NASS (best option)
```

---

### PHASE 2: DESIGN (Analysis Definition)

**Objective:** DEFINE which analyses to implement

**Process:**
1. Brainstorm typical questions (10-15)
2. Group by type (comparisons, rankings, trends)
3. **DEFINES** 4-6 priority analyses
4. Specifies methodologies (mathematical formulas)

**Autonomy:** Claude prioritizes by value and frequency of use!

---

### PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURE (Structuring)

**Objective:** STRUCTURE the project optimally

**Process:**
1. Defines folder structure
2. Specifies scripts and responsibilities
3. Plans cache strategy
4. Defines validations

**Autonomy:** Claude chooses optimal architecture based on complexity!

---

### PHASE 4: DETECTION (Automatic Activation)

**Objective:** DETERMINE keywords for detection

**Process:**
1. Lists domain entities
2. Lists typical actions
3. Determines keywords
4. Creates optimized description (150-250 words)

**Result:** Skill activates automatically when user asks relevant question!

---

### PHASE 5: IMPLEMENTATION (Complete Code)

**Objective:** IMPLEMENT everything with REAL code

**Process:**
```bash
1. mkdir -p agent-name/{scripts/utils,references,assets,.claude-plugin}
2. Write: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json  ← REQUIRED!
3. Write: SKILL.md (5000+ words)
4. Write: scripts/*.py (functional code)
5. Write: utils/*.py (cache, validators, etc)
6. Write: references/*.md (useful content)
7. Write: assets/*.json (real configs)
8. Write: README.md + DECISIONS.md
```

**Quality Standards:**
- ✅ Complete code (no `TODO` or `pass`)
- ✅ Detailed docstrings
- ✅ Robust error handling
- ✅ Type hints
- ✅ Comprehensive validations

**Result:** Production-ready agent!
