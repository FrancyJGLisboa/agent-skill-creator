# Quick Verification Guide: AgentDB Learning Capabilities

## 📊 Current Database State

```bash
agentdb db stats
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **3 episodes** stored (agent creation experiences)
- ✅ **4 causal edges** mapped (cause-effect relationships)
- ✅ **3 skills** created (reusable patterns)

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Learning

### 1. Check Reflexion Memory (Episodes)

**View similar past experiences:**
```bash
agentdb reflexion retrieve "financial analysis" 5 0.6
```

**What you'll see:**
- Past agent creations with similarity scores
- Success rates and rewards
- Critiques and lessons learned

### 2. Search Skill Library

**Find relevant skills:**
```bash
agentdb skill search "stock" 5
```

**What you'll see:**
- Reusable code patterns
- Success rates and usage statistics
- Descriptions of what each skill does

### 3. Query Causal Relationships

**What causes improvements:**
```bash
agentdb causal query "use_financial_template" "" 0.5 0.1 10
```

**What you'll see:**
- Uplift percentages (% improvement)
- Confidence scores (how certain)
- Sample sizes (data points)

## 🧪 Test the Learning Yourself

### Option 1: Run the Test Script
```bash
python3 test_agentdb_learning.py
```

This populates the database with sample data and verifies all capabilities.

### Option 2: Create Actual Agents

1. Create first agent:
   ```
   "Create financial analysis agent for stock market data"
   ```

2. Check database growth:
   ```bash
   agentdb db stats
   ```

3. Create second similar agent:
   ```
   "Create portfolio tracking agent with technical indicators"
   ```

4. Query for learned improvements:
   ```bash
   agentdb reflexion retrieve "financial" 5 0.6
   ```

5. See the recommendations improve!
