---

## 🎯 Activation System (3-Layer Architecture)

This skill demonstrates the **3-Layer Activation System v3.0** for reliable skill detection.

### Layer 1: Keywords (Exact Phrase Matching)

**Purpose:** High-precision activation for explicit requests

**Keywords (15 total):**
```json
[
  "analyze stock",           // Primary action
  "stock analysis",          // Alternative phrasing
  "technical analysis for",  // Domain-specific
  "RSI indicator",          // Specific indicator 1
  "MACD indicator",         // Specific indicator 2
  "Bollinger Bands",        // Specific indicator 3
  "buy signal for",         // Signal requests
  "sell signal for",        // Signal requests
  "compare stocks",         // Comparison action
  "stock comparison",       // Alternative
  "monitor stock",          // Monitoring action
  "track stock price",      // Tracking action
  "chart pattern",          // Pattern analysis
  "moving average for",     // Technical indicator
  "stock momentum"          // Momentum analysis
]
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Action verbs: analyze, compare, monitor, track
- ✅ Domain entities: stock, ticker, indicator
- ✅ Specific indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger
- ✅ Use cases: signals, comparison, monitoring

### Layer 2: Patterns (Flexible Regex Matching)

**Purpose:** Capture natural language variations and combinations

**Patterns (7 total):**

**Pattern 1: General Stock Analysis**
```regex
(?i)(analyze|analysis)\s+.*\s+(stock|stocks?|ticker|equity|equities)s?
```
Matches: "analyze AAPL stock", "analysis of tech stocks", "analyze this ticker"

**Pattern 2: Technical Analysis Request**
```regex
(?i)(technical|chart)\s+(analysis|indicators?)\s+(for|of|on)
```
Matches: "technical analysis for MSFT", "chart indicators of SPY", "technical analysis on AAPL"

**Pattern 3: Specific Indicator Request**
```regex
(?i)(RSI|MACD|Bollinger)\s+(for|of|indicator|analysis)
```
Matches: "RSI for AAPL", "MACD indicator", "Bollinger analysis of TSLA"

**Pattern 4: Signal Generation**
```regex
(?i)(buy|sell)\s+(signal|recommendation|suggestion)\s+(for|using)
```
Matches: "buy signal for NVDA", "sell recommendation using RSI", "buy suggestion for AAPL"

**Pattern 5: Stock Comparison**
```regex
(?i)(compare|comparison|rank)\s+.*\s+stocks?\s+(using|by|with)
```
Matches: "compare AAPL vs MSFT using RSI", "rank stocks by momentum", "comparison of stocks with MACD"

**Pattern 6: Monitoring & Tracking**
```regex
(?i)(monitor|track|watch)\s+.*\s+(stock|ticker|price)s?
```
Matches: "monitor AMZN stock", "track TSLA price", "watch these tickers"

**Pattern 7: Moving Average & Momentum**
```regex
(?i)(moving average|momentum|volatility)\s+(for|of|analysis)
```
Matches: "moving average for SPY", "momentum analysis of QQQ", "volatility of AAPL"

### Layer 3: Description + NLU (Natural Language Understanding)

**Purpose:** Fallback coverage for edge cases and natural phrasing

**Enhanced Description (80+ keywords):**
```

volume patterns, and momentum indicators including RSI (Relative Strength Index),
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), Bollinger Bands, moving averages,
and chart patterns. Generates buy and sell signals based on technical indicators.
Compares multiple stocks for relative strength analysis. Monitors stock performance
and tracks price alerts. Perfect for traders needing technical analysis, chart
interpretation, momentum tracking, volatility assessment, and comparative stock
evaluation using proven technical analysis methods and trading indicators.
```

**Key Terms Included:**
- Action verbs: analyzes, generates, compares, monitors, tracks
- Domain entities: stocks, ETFs, tickers, equities
- Indicators: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages
- Use cases: buy signals, sell signals, comparison, alerts, monitoring

```

### Indicator Calculators

Each indicator has dedicated calculator following Single Responsibility Principle:

- **RSICalculator**: Computes Relative Strength Index
- **MACDCalculator**: Computes Moving Average Convergence Divergence
- **BollingerCalculator**: Computes Bollinger Bands (upper, middle, lower)

### Signal Generator

Interprets indicator combinations to produce buy/sell/hold recommendations:

```python
class SignalGenerator:
    """Generates trading signals from technical indicators"""

    def generate(self, ticker: str, data: pd.DataFrame, indicators: Dict):
        """
        Generate trading signal from indicator combination

        Strategy: Combined RSI + MACD approach
        - BUY: RSI < 50 and MACD bullish crossover
        - SELL: RSI > 70 and MACD bearish crossover
        - HOLD: Otherwise
        """
        rsi = indicators.get('RSI', {}).get('value')
        macd = indicators.get('MACD', {})

        signal = "HOLD"
        confidence = "low"
        reasoning = []

        # RSI analysis
        if rsi and rsi < 30:
            reasoning.append("RSI oversold (< 30)")
            signal = "BUY"
            confidence = "moderate"
        elif rsi and rsi > 70:
            reasoning.append("RSI overbought (> 70)")
            signal = "SELL"
            confidence = "moderate"

        # MACD analysis
        if macd.get('signal') == 'bullish_crossover':
            reasoning.append("MACD bullish crossover")
            if signal == "BUY":
                confidence = "high"
            else:
                signal = "BUY"

        return {
            'action': signal,
            'confidence': confidence,
            'reasoning': reasoning
        }
```
